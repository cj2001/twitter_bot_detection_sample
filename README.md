# Twitter bot detection sample work

This is a Jupyter Notebook of a machine learning-backed detection of Twitter bots.  It is not intended to be productionalized code, but rather to walk through my ML thought process.  The notebook has many comments in it regarding the data source and methodology in lieu of a complete README file.
